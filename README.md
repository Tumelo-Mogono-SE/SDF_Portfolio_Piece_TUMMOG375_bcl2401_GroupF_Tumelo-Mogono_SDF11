# Challenges
I had challenges with the navigation bar, more specifically the nesting of the multiple div elements. I also still have challenges styling the SVG's without getting the source code of specific SVG's. Aside from these challenge the project's was smooth.

# What i learned
I learned more techniques to have a reponsive professionally looking website, which focus on a mobile first design approach. I learned alot of utilizing nested div elements for better layering to have a better white spacing and positioning of content in the webpage. I gained more experience for using the class.toggle function  in javascript for event listeners by applying it again in this projects.
